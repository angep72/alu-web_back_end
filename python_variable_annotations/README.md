### This is the variable annotations
ariable annotations in Python let you specify the type of a variable to make your code easier to understand and work with. For example, writing age: int = 25 means "age is expected to be an integer." These type hints don't actually enforce the type at runtime but are useful for tools like code editors and static type checkers to catch mistakes and improve autocomplete. You can also use them without assigning a value, like name: str, to indicate that name should be a string. They help make your code clearer and easier to maintain, especially in larger projects.
